Delve into the basics with a focus on functions. Functions are like recipes. Imagine having a set of instructions to make a sandwich - that's a function! 
It is a set of instructions that performs a specific task, follow by learing about:

arguments which is the ingredients for thefunction,\
return values same like the outcome of your recipe, and \
variables which contain your ingredients.
